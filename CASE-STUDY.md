# 🏗️ Case Study — Deploying Governed AI in a Regulated Enterprise

**Context**  
A Fortune 500 health-tech firm sought to pilot LLM-assisted customer support for glucose sensor users. Regulatory risk and cost visibility were the two major barriers.

---

## 🔍 Problem
- Inconsistent prompt behavior; no audit trail or cost tracking.  
- Compliance teams rejected rollout due to PHI exposure risk.  
- Monthly LLM spend exceeded forecast by 22 %.

## 🧭 Approach (TrustGate Suite)
| Layer | Artifact | Outcome |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Governance** | `risk-register-template.xlsx`, `governance-scorecard.md` | Established risk taxonomy & KPIs (coverage ↑ from 40 % → 71 %) |
| **Finance** | `ai-budget-tracker.md`, `Budget-Playbook.xlsx` | Forecast variance cut to < 10 %; finance alignment achieved |
| **Gateway (FastAPI)** | [trustgate-fastapi](https://github.com/skatwala/trustgate-fastapi) | Implemented `trace_id` headers and structured logs with OTEL |
| **Evaluation Harness** | [trustgate-evals](https://github.com/skatwala/trustgate-evals) | Monthly LLM quality and cost regression testing |
| **Reference Architecture** | [compliance-ai-reference-arch](https://github.com/skatwala/compliance-ai-reference-arch) | Delta Lake lineage & Unity Catalog masking for auditability |

## 📈 Outcomes (6 Months)

| Metric | Before | After | Δ (Improvement) |
|---------|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Risk Coverage** | 40 % | 80 % | +100 % |
| **Residual Risk Score** | 8.1 | 5.2 | -36 % |
| **Cost Variance** | 22 % | 6 % | -73 % |
| **Incident MTTR** | 72 h | 20 h | -72 % |
| **Audit Readiness** | Partial | Full (ISO 23894 Aligned) | ✅ |

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
1. **Trace IDs and prompt logs** create trust with auditors faster than PowerPoints.  
2. **Finance and AI Ops alignment** reduces cost escalation more than model tuning.  
3. **Cross-repo governance** (tech + policy + finance) turns compliance into a competitive advantage.
