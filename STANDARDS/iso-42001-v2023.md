# 📘 ISO/IEC 42001 — Versioned Reference (2023 AI Management System)

This document provides a **version-pinned reference** for **ISO/IEC 42001:2023**,  
the world’s first international standard for **AI Management Systems (AIMS)**.

It summarizes the requirements and maps each area to components of this repository,  
supporting **audit readiness**, **regulatory alignment**, and **enterprise governance**.

---

# 🔹 1. ISO 42001 Overview (2023)

ISO/IEC 42001 defines requirements for:

1. **AI Management System (AIMS) Structure**
2. **Leadership & Governance**
3. **Planning & Risk Assessment**
4. **Operational Controls**
5. **Monitoring & Evaluation**
6. **Continuous Improvement**

The standard parallels ISO 27001/9001 formats but applies specifically to AI.
