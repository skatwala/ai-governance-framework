# 🧾 Executive Decision Memo

**Subject:** Transition to Unified Speech-to-Text Gateway Architecture  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Owner:** Director, AI Integration & Compliance Systems  

---

## 🧭 Context
Current transcription services rely on fragmented vendor APIs (Azure, GCP). This increases cost, latency, and audit complexity.

## 💡 Decision
Adopt a unified FastAPI-based STT Gateway leveraging vendor adapters (Azure, GCP, OpenAI). This enables consistent observability, retry logic, and traceability.

## ⚙️ Rationale
- Centralized auditing for all voice pipelines  
- Reduced mean-time-to-repair by 40%  
- Simplified API key management via K8s secrets  
- Future-proof design with vendor fallback logic  

## 📈 Financial Impact
- Initial investment: $80,000 (Q1)  
- Ongoing OpEx reduction: ~15% annually  
- Total ROI expected within 12 months  

## 🔒 Risk & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Vendor API change | Medium | Versioned adapters + automated test suite |
| Latency increase | Medium | AsyncIO concurrency + Redis caching |
| Governance drift | High | Apply TrustGate decorators across routes |

## ✅ Next Steps
- Complete MVP deployment by Dec 2025  
- Begin phased rollout in Q1 2026  
- Conduct compliance audit review post-rollout
